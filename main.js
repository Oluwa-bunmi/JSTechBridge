// declare variables with let, const or var

let career = "Frontend Development";
let student = "Mr Taiwo";

// string interpolation using template literals
console.log(`${student} is studying ${career} and he is two years old`);

// Another example of string interpolation
var color = "blue";
var age = 24;
var gender = "male";
// he is a male of age 24 and his best color is blue
console.log(`he is a ${gender} of age ${age} and his best color is ${color}`);

// data type number
let numOne = 2;
let numTwo = 3;
console.log(numOne * numTwo);

// data type boolean i.e true or false
console.log("2" == 2);
console.log(typeof 2);
// console.log(typeof(2));
console.log(typeof false);

// == or === means equality in js
